\medskip
\medskip
The primary data  collected or created during this project include:
source codes, intermediate output from large runs and final results to be used in publications. All this data
will be stored in digital form at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory by each member of the group.
A shared group directory will be created by the NSCL computer department for our group. When a milestone in a project is reached,
or a member leaves the group (e.g. after graduation), the person directly involved  will prepare a clean directory with all relevant information
(source codes, results, figures, etc) and copied it over to the shared group directory.
 
The NSCL computer department has a multi-level backup system, with daily logs and off-site copies ensuring a safe long-term archive.
If requested, data can be made available to other researchers in our field. Codes that are produced for the projects included in this proposal
will be made available upon request, after publication of our results.
