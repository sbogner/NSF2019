\section{Project Description}


\subsection{Overview}
\label{Overview}
One of the fundamental challenges in nuclear physics is to understand
why nucleonic matter is stable, how it comes into being, how it
evolves and organizes itself, and what phenomena emerge. The task
facing nuclear theorists is to develop the tools to help answer these
questions by relating the existence and properties of nuclei to the
underlying fundamental forces and degrees of freedom. As experimental
efforts have shifted towards the study of rare
isotopes~\cite{Geesaman:2015fha,NSACdecadal,Balantekin:2014opa}, there
has been an increased urgency to develop reliable \emph{ab initio}
calculations to counter the inherent limitations of ``data-driven''
approaches which rely on experimental data to constrain model
parameters, such as the phenomenological shell model and density
functional theory. For decades \emph{ab initio} progress was slowed by
the lack of a consistent theory for the strong inter-nucleon
interactions, and by the computational demands required to handle the
non-perturbative aspects resulting from the ``hard cores'' and strong
tensor forces found in most interaction models.  For many years, the
only option for controlled calculations was to use quasi-exact methods
such as quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) or no-core shell model (NCSM), which
limited the reach of \emph{ab initio} calculations to light $p$-shell
nuclei. Approximate (but systematically improvable) methods that scale
favorably to larger systems, like coupled cluster (CC) theory and
many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), were largely abandoned in
nuclear physics, despite enjoying tremendous success in quantum
chemistry.


Much has changed in recent years, as advances in chiral effective
field theory (EFT), which provides a systematic framework to construct
consistent two- and three-nucleon
interactions~\cite{vanKolck:1999mw,Epelbaum:2009ve,Epelbaum:2015fb,Machleidt:2011bh,Entem:2003th},
together with the development of powerful renormalization group (RG)
methods to transform interactions to much softer
forms~\cite{Bogner:2010pq,Bogner:2003wn,Bogner:2006vp,Bogner:2006pc},
have led to a resurgence of CC and similar methods, and the
development of new ones such as the in-medium similarity
renormalization group (IMSRG)~\cite{Hergert:2015awm}, pushing the
frontiers of \emph{ab initio} theory well into the medium-mass
region~\cite{Tsukiyama:2011uq,Tsukiyama:2012fk,Bogner:2014tg,Jansen:2014qf,Jansen:2015ngw,Stroberg:2015ymf,Stroberg:2016ung,Soma:2013ys,Soma:2014fu,Soma:2014eu,Hergert:2013ij,Hergert:2014vn,Hergert:2016etg,Wienholtz:2013bh,Hagen:2015ve,jansenprl2016}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:abinitio}. Initial
applications of these methods were limited primarily to ground-state
properties of stable nuclei near shell closures with two-nucleon
forces only. Substantial progress has since been made on including
three-nucleon forces~\cite{Hagen:2007zc,Soma:2013xha,Roth:2012qf,Hergert:2012nb}, targeting excited states and observables besides
energy~\cite{Ekstrom:2014iya,Jansen:2012ey}, and moving into the more
challenging terrain of open-shell and unstable
nuclei~\cite{Tsukiyama:2012fk,Jansen:2014qf,Bogner:2014tg,Stroberg:2015ymf,Stroberg:2016ung,Soma:2013ys,Soma:2012zd,Hergert:2013ij,Gebrerufael:2016xih}. The recent work of Jansen {\em et al} \cite{jansenprl2016} on the structure of $^{78}$Ni and nearby nuclei represents some of the progress which has been made recently in pushing the limits of first principle methods. Remarkably,
progress on the many-body front has been so swift in recent years that
inadequacies of the current-generation chiral two- and three-nucleon
interactions, rather than the many-body calculations themselves, are
the primary obstacles to systematic calculations across the
medium-mass region~\cite{Ekstrom:2015fk,Binder:2014fk}.

Both applicants have played significant roles in key developments that
have driven the progress shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:abinitio}. For
instance, on the interactions side Bogner has been closely involved
with the development of new RG technologies to evolve inter-nucleon
interactions and operators to softer
forms~\cite{Bogner:2001gq,Bogner:2006vp,Bogner:2006pc,Bogner:2010pq},
while Hjorth-Jensen has been actively involved with efforts to
generate improved chiral EFT interactions through the use of better
fitting protocols and advanced statistical
tools~\cite{Ekstrom:2013kea,Ekstrom:2014dxa,Ekstrom:2015rta}.  On the
many-body side, Bogner and collaborators were the first to introduce
the IMSRG framework to nuclear
physics~\cite{Bogner:2010pq,Tsukiyama:2011uq,Tsukiyama:2012fk}, and
have been centrally involved in many of the subsequent extensions and
applications of the
method~\cite{Hergert:2014vn,Bogner:2014tg,Morris:2015ve,Stroberg:2015ymf,Hergert:2015awm}. Likewise,
Hjorth-Jensen and collaborators initiated the revival of CC methods in
nuclear physics nearly 15 years ago~\cite{Dean:2002bx,Dean:2003vc} ,
and have been involved in most of the subsequent applications to
nuclei and nuclear
matter~\cite{Hagen:2012sh,Hagen:2013nca,Jansen:2011gb,Jensen:2011mv,Hagen:2016xjv}.



In the following, we present a research plan to develop a
comprehensive many-body framework based on CC and IMSRG methods that
seeks to fulfill the following general criteria: i) calculations must
make use of the best available chiral EFT two- and three-nucleon
interactions and come with controllable (i.e., quantifiable)
theoretical uncertainties, ii) approximations/truncations in the
many-body theory must be systematically improvable, iii) the formalism
must be able to account for the open-quantum-system aspects of loosely
bound and unbound nuclear states that couple to the continuum, iv) the
formalism should be capable of treating a range of systems from finite
nuclei (ground and excited states, open-shell and closed-shell,
well-bound and loosely-bound, etc.) to equation of state calculations
of infinite matter of relevance for studies of proto-neutron stars and neutron stars.


A complete theoretical picture which addresses this range of systems
requires a proper link between many different energy and length
scales\footnote{A simultaneous description of nuclei and neutrons
stars spans over 19 orders of magnitude, from several $10^{-15}$\,m
(nuclear radii) to approximately 10 kilometers (neutron star radii).}.
In nuclear physics, the optimal theoretical description is
``resolution dependent'', in that phenomena at each energy scale has
an appropriate (i.e., most convenient) effective theory and
corresponding set of degrees of freedom. One of the central challenges
for theory is to understand how connections between different
effective descriptions emerge at the boundaries.  This is an
interesting theoretical problem in and of itself, but it also carries
important practical implications. For example, phenomenological shell
model and density functional theory methods, both of which are
low-resolution descriptions, have been extremely successful in making
predictions and describing experiment \emph{in the vicinity} of the
data to which they were fit to, but tend to give uncontrolled
extrapolations away from this region.  One of the central aims of our
proposed research is to use controlled \emph{ab initio} calculations
(a high-resolution description) to constrain the form and values of
couplings in low-resolution shell model interactions and Skyrme-like
energy density functionals, with the goal of improving their
predictive power away from known data.


The methods in this proposal have the potential to
dramatically increase our understanding of a new frontier in nuclear
physics, namely the role of three-nucleon forces in the evolution
of nuclear structure and dense matter. Neutron-rich nuclei are particularly interesting
to study these effects~\cite{Otsuka:2009cs,Holt:2011fj,Holt:2014aya}, where
the modification of magic numbers, formation of neutron skins and
halos, and detailed tests of shell structure at the limit of
neutron-to-proton asymmetry can be probed via investigations of
masses, radii, and excited states~\cite{Wienholtz:2013bh,Hagen:2015ve,jansenprl2016}. Global theoretical
studies of long isotopic chains, such as the chains of calcium, nickel or
tin isotopes, make it possible to systematically test properties of
nuclear Hamiltonians and many-body methods.  A quantitative
comparison of various experimental data with quantified theoretical
uncertainties still remains a major challenge for nuclear science. To
address this shortcoming, a key component of our research will
be to seek a better understanding of the theoretical uncertainties
that arise from the interplay of truncation errors of the chiral EFT interactions, uncertainties in the
fitted parameters of the low-energy constants, truncated renormalization
group evolution to ``soften'' the input Hamiltonian, basis-set
truncation errors, and truncation errors in the particular level of
many-body approximation.

The development of {\em ab initio} many-body theories for nuclei is also
intimately linked with the determination and our understanding of the
equation of state (EoS) for nuclear matter.  The CC and IMSRG methods are both promising 
candidates to carry out controlled EoS
calculations starting from chiral NN and NNN interactions, due in
equal measure to their computational scalability and flexibility. Bulk nucleonic matter is
interesting for several reasons. The EoS of neutron matter, for
instance, determines properties of supernova
explosions~\cite{Sumiyoshi:2005ri,Murphy:2009dx} and neutron
stars~\cite{Hebeler:2014ema, Lattimer:2000kb, Lattimer:2000nx},
and it relates the latter to neutron radii in atomic
nuclei~\cite{Brown:2000pd, Horowitz:2000xj}. Likewise, the compressibility of
nuclear matter is probed in isoscalar giant monopole
excitations~\cite{Shlomo:1993zz}, and the symmetry energy of nuclear
matter is related to the difference between proton and neutron radii
in atomic nuclei~\cite{Abrahamyan:2012gp,Reinhard:2013fpa}. We also
note that the saturation point of nuclear matter determines bulk
properties of atomic nuclei, and therefore is an important constraint
for nuclear energy-density functionals and mass models~\cite{Kortelainen:2011ft,Bertsch:2004us}.  Finally, our calculations of in-medium
operators and interactions can be used to evaluate, with state-of-the-art Hamiltonians,
neutrino emissivities and spectra in dense objects like neutron stars and proto-neutron stars \cite{Balasi:2015dba,Lohs:2015qyn}.

Numerous components of our proposed
research mesh well with the research interests of other NSCL theory
faculty, which will lead to increased opportunities for
collaboration. Heiko Hergert, who is a former postdoc of Bogner and
who joined the faculty in 2015, has been (and will continue to be) a
frequent collaborator on IMSRG-related topics. Our research on
constructing \emph{ab initio} shell model Hamiltonians via CC,
IMSRG, and MBPT methods is complementary to the expertise of Alex Brown, who is
a leading shell model practitioner and developer of phenomenological
shell model interactions. Similarly, our proposed development of the
equation of state calculations is highly relevant to the research of
Pawel Danielewicz and Filomena Nunes on the nuclear symmetry energy
and transport theory for heavy-ion reactions, as well as new hire Luke
Roberts and his research on the role of neutrinos and core-collapse supernovae.

%active role in organizing and lecturing at the Nuclear TALENT summer schools 
%(Hjorth-Jensen serves on the TALENT advisory board). The graduate
%nuclear physics program at MSU is consistently ranked at the top of
%various rankings, and the theory group has enjoyed a very good track
%record in attracting the top graduate students at MSU, including
%members of underrepresented groups (e.g., the PI's first PhD student who graduated in 2011, Biruk
%Gebremariam).  In recent
%years, the number of theory students has steadily increased to the
%current value of approximately 2 students per PI. Students and

\subsubsection{Workshops and programs organized (2011-present)}

Both PIs have been involved in the organization of several workshops
and schools during the last five years.  The Nuclear Talent
initiative, which Hjorth-Jensen initiated together with several
colleagues from Europe and the US, see \url{www.nucleartalent.org} for
more information, has now offered eleven courses in Nuclear Theory
since 2012, with approximately 40 applicants per course. Both PIs have
been active teachers and organizers of several Nuclear Talent
courses. This initiative has developed a broad nuclear physics curriculum, taught
through intensive three-week courses, that provides the
platform for a cutting-edge theory for understanding nuclei and
nuclear reactions.  This initiative has been well-received by the
nuclear physics community. In addition to the Nuclear Talent courses,
both PIs have been active in organizing other schools and
workshops/conferences.  During the last five years we have organized
11 schools, workshops and meetings. These are listed in the supplementary documentation.

\subsubsection{Guidance of students (2011-present)}

In the period of 2011-present, Bogner has supervised 7 graduate students at the NSCL. Of
these students, 2 have graduated with Ph.D.'s, 4
currently remain in the Ph.D. program under SB's supervision, and 1 has 
decided to leave with a Masters degree in Spring 2017.  The first
Ph.D. recipient (Biruk Gebremariam, 2011) is a software analyst for the
company SAS, while second Ph.D. recipient (Titus Morris, 2016) is presently
a postdoc at the University of Tennesse and Oak Ridge National Lab. Of the
4 current Ph.D. students, 3 are co-supervised with Morten Hjorth-Jensen,
see below.
 
Hjorth-Jensen started at MSU in January 2012, and spends half the year
(January-June) in the USA and the other half at the University of Oslo
in Norway. Norway follows the standard European setup for higher
education, where a Master of Science degree is compulsory in order to
enlist in a Ph.D. program.  The Master of Science degree consists of
one year of course work and one year of own research work, often
ending in a scientific article.  In the period 2011-2016, three
Ph.D. students and 22 M.S. students finalized their theses with
Hjorth-Jensen as supervisor. Of the three Ph.D. students, two are
presently post-doctoral fellows in Norway at the University of Oslo
while Gustav Jansen (PhD 2012) is now permanent staff at the
Computational Science Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Of
the 22 M.S. students, 12 have continued with Ph.D.  studies in
Norway. Hjorth-Jensen presently supervises (either as primary or as
secondary supervisor) four Ph.D. students at MSU and eight
M.S. students at the University of Oslo. Three of the students at MSU
are co-supervised with Scott Bogner.


The applicants have a total of five graduate students at present. Nathan
Parzuchowski works with Bogner and will finish his Ph.D. by the end of
Spring 2017.  The primary topic of his thesis is the development of
new \emph{ab initio} methods to calculate excited-state properties
(spectra, transition densities, response functions, etc.)  in
medium-mass nuclei by merging Equation of Motion (EOM) methods with
the IMSRG.  He has been supported in part by Bogner's PHY-1068648,
PHY-1404159 and SciDAC NUCLEI grants since he joined the group in
Summer 2013.

The four remaining students, Justin Lietz, Sam Novario, Fei Yuan, and
John Bower are co-supervised by Hjorth-Jensen and Bogner.  All four
students have received partial support from NSF Grant No. PHY-1404159
and the SciDAC NUCLEI grant. Yuan joined the group in Fall 2013, and
is working on implementing the IMSRG in a complex Gamow basis to
properly treat continuum effects for loosely bound states. He is
projected to finish his Ph.D. by the end of Fall 2017. Lietz joined
the group in Fall 2013 and is projected to finish his Ph.D. in Spring
2018, with a focus on computational elements of coupled-cluster theory
and the IMSRG, with applications to infinite matter calculations to
constrain neutrino interactions in matter. Novario joined the group in
Summer 2014 after spending three years in the experimental nuclear
physics program.  He is expected to complete his Ph.D. by the end of
Summer 2017 on effective operators from coupled-cluster
theory. Bower joined the group in Summer 2015, and is going to leave
with Masters degree in Spring 2017.





\subsubsection{Results under prior NSF support: Intellectual Merit  }
In the present section, we give a brief summary of the \emph{intellectual merit} of the PIs accomplishments under prior NSF support from 2011-present.  We focus only on activities that are of primary importance to our proposed research. The \emph{broader impacts} of our prior NSF-supported research will be discussed below.
\begin{itemize}

\item{\bf In-medium SRG for Nuclei.} The Similarity
Renormalization Group (SRG) was developed in the early 1990's by
Wilson and Glazek~\cite{Glazek:1993il}, and by
Wegner~\cite{Wegner:1994dk}. In Ref.~\cite{Bogner:2006pc}, Bogner \emph{et al.} 
made the first applications of the SRG to low-energy nuclear
physics to soften two-nucleon interactions, which has since become a ubiquitous tool in \emph{ab initio} theory~\cite{Bogner:2010pq,Binder:2013zr,Hupin:2013uq,Roth:2011kx}.  Subsequently, Bogner and collaborators formulated an alternative version of the SRG  in which the evolution is performed ``in-medium'' (i.e., directly in the $A$-body system of interest) rather than in vacuum~\cite{Tsukiyama:2011uq, Tsukiyama:2012fk}.  In contrast to the free-space SRG, the
in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) approach enables one to approximately evolve $3,...,A$-body operators
using only two-body machinery based on normal-ordering
techniques. The IMSRG is a powerful \emph{ab initio} framework because it offers several paths to calculate ground and excited state properties for closed- and open-shell medium-mass nuclei, see for instance the two recent review articles~\cite{Hergert:2015awm,Hergert:2016etg}. 
%ranging from {\em ab initio} calculations of closed-shell nuclei and nuclear
%matter~\cite{tsukiyama2011,tsukiyama2012,hergert2012}, to the construction of
%effective valence shell-model Hamiltonians and multi-reference
%extensions of the IMSRG to treat open-shell
%systems~\cite{tsukiyama2012, Hergert:2013uja}.

%\begin{enumerate}

\item{\bf Ground-state IMSRG for closed-shell systems.} The IMSRG was originally developed to target the ground states of closed-shell systems~\cite{Tsukiyama:2011uq}. Over the past five years, calculations have been performed for all closed shell nuclei up thru $^{56}$Ni with initial three-nucleon forces~\cite{Hergert:2015awm, Hergert:2013mi}. Calculations have also been performed for non-nuclear systems like the electron gas, two-dimensional parabolic quantum dots, and diatomic molecules at equilibrium geometries~\cite{sarahthesis, TitusThesis}. In the simplest IMSRG(2) truncation, where the flow equations are truncated at the normal-ordered two-body level, ground-state energies track CCSD(T) calculations with approximate triples excitations more closely than the analogous CCSD results. This apparent higher-order accuracy was explained by analyzing the low-order MBPT content of the IMSRG(2) and CCSD approximations, where it was shown that the former undercounts a set of repulsive 4th-order terms by a factor of 1/2, which mimics the partial cancellation against attractive triples contributions~\cite{Evangelista, TitusThesis,Hergert:2015awm}.  
 
\item {\bf Magnus expansion formulation of the IMSRG.} In the traditional IMSRG formulation, one solves coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the evolved Hamiltonian matrix elements. To maintain unitary equivalence, it is necessary to use a high-order method to prevent the accumulation of ``time-step'' errors. High-order solvers can require the storage of 10-20 copies of the solution vector, resulting in a large memory overhead. The problem is exacerbated if one calculates additional observables, as the number of flow equations is roughly doubled in size for each. In Ref.~\cite{Morris:2015ve}, we showed how a naive first-order Euler method can be used to solve reformulated IMSRG equations without any degradation in accuracy. The new formulation uses the Magnus expansion to solve for the operator $\Omega$ that parameterizes the IMSRG unitary transformation $U = e^{\Omega}$, rather than solving flow equations for the Hamiltonian. The transformed Hamiltonian, and any additional observables of interest, can then obtained by the direct application of $U$. The resulting computational savings are substantial, and the calculation of additional observables carries almost no additional cost.  Additionally, the Magnus formulation provides a simple framework to construct computationally-feasible approximations to the IMSRG(3) truncation, which have been successfully implemented and tested for 2d quantum dots, the homogenous electron gas, and diatomic molecules at equilibrium and stretched geometries~\cite{TitusThesis}.   

 \item {\bf \emph{Ab initio} construction of shell model
 interactions.} For open-shell nuclei, one promising approach is to
 use the IMSRG to construct a valence-space Hamiltonian that is diagonalized using shell model
 machinery.  In Ref.~\cite{Bogner:2014tg}, the first IMSRG calculations of valence-space Hamiltonians 
 based on chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions 
 were presented. When applied to the neutron-rich oxygen isotopes,
 natural-parity spectra are in excellent
 agreement with experiment. However, ground-state energies show systematic overbinding as more
 neutrons are added due to the neglect of
 three-nucleon interactions among valence nucleons.  In two
 subsequent works~\cite{Stroberg:2015ymf,Stroberg:2016ung}, this was
 remedied using improved normal ordering procedures. The improved formulations correct the ground-state
 systematics, bringing the valence space calculations into excellent
 agreement with the large-space methods for a wide range of isotope
 chains from Carbon thru Nickel. Additionally, ``emergent phenomena''
 such as Yrast rotational bands in deformed nuclei such as $^{24}$Mg
 and $^{20}$Ne are accurately captured in our \emph{ab initio} shell model
 approach. The inclusion of initial three-nucleon forces improves
 spectra for a wide range of isotope chains, clearly demonstrating
 their importance in \emph{ab initio} studies of nuclear structure.
 
 \item {\bf Multi-reference formulation of the IMSRG.} The
 multi-reference formulation of the IMSRG (MR-IMSRG) is an appealing alternative to target open-shell
 systems~\cite{Hergert:2013ij} that bypasses the
 large-scale matrix diagonalizations required for
 midshell nuclei and/or extended valence spaces. In the MR-IMSRG, the
 ground states of even-even nuclei are targeted directly by using a
 number-projected Hartree Fock Bogoliobuv (HFB) reference state. In
 Ref.~\cite{Hergert:2014vn}, the method was used to calculate
 even-even ground states for Nickel and Calcium chains starting from
 chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions. At sub-shell closures,
 the MR-IMSRG results are in excellent agreement with CC calculations,
 and clearly show the importance of initial three-nucleon interactions
 to obtain a correct reproduction of experimental energy trends.
 
 \item {\bf EOM-IMSRG for excited states.}  In
 Ref.~\cite{Parzuchowski:2016njm}, we presented a new approach to 
 calculate excited states in medium-mass nuclei by merging 
 equations-of-motion (EOM) techniques~\cite{Rowe:1968eq} with the IMSRG. 
 Proof-of-principle calculations were performed for parabolic
 quantum dots in two-dimensions and the closed shell nuclei $^{16}$O
 and $^{22}$O.  The calculated spectra are in reasonable agreement with
 analogous EOM-coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) calculations, which paves the
 way for more interesting applications such as calculations of electromagnetic strength functions and transitions,
 extensions to nuclei within 1-2 nucleons of a closed shell, and merging the EOM with the MR-IMSRG to 
 access open-shell nuclei.

\item {\bf \emph{Ab initio} studies of infinite nuclear matter.}
  Studies of dense baryonic matter are of central importance to our
  basic understanding of the stability of nuclear matter, spanning
  from matter at high densities and temperatures to matter found
  within dense objects like neutron stars. In four recent publications we have studied the equation
  of state for dense nuclear matter using CC theory in a
  cartesian basis. We have performed CC calculations at the CCD and CCD(T) levels (doubles and triples excitations, respectively) with and
  without chiral three-body forces
  \cite{Baardsen:2013vwa,Hagen:2013yba}.  These calculations agree
  well with results from quantum Monte Carlo computations. We found that
  neutron matter with interactions from chiral EFT is almost perturbative,
  while symmetric nuclear matter requires nonperturbative
  approaches, with correlations beyond the standard particle-particle
  ladder approximation yielding non-negligible contributions. The
  saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter is sensitive to the
  employed NNN forces and the employed regularization scheme.

  In two recent book chapters to be published in the series Lecture
  Notes in Physics by Springer \cite{lnp}, see also the discussion
  below on broader impacts, we have together with our graduate students
  and other colleagues, detailed the development of a
  computational many-body scheme for infinite nuclear matter using
  both CC theory and IMSRG. The codes and formalism exposed in this
  texts shows how to evaluate correlations at the level of $2p-2h$
  excitations for CC theory (CCD, doubles only) and IMSRG (IMSRG(2)). These codes can easily be
  extended to include more complicated correlations as well as
  realistic chiral interactions. The work here lays the foundation for
  our future plans described in the project description section.


\item {\bf \emph{Ab initio} Properties of nuclei with optimized
    nuclear Hamiltonians.}  Together with external collaborators, we have developed predictive
  {\em ab initio} nuclear hamiltonians for light and medium-mass
  nuclei with two-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral
  effective field theory.  The parameters of these potentials have
  been optimized simultaneously to low-energy nucleon-nucleon
  scattering data, as well as binding energies and radii of
  few-nucleon systems and selected isotopes of carbon and
  oxygen. When used in many-body calculations, the optimized Hamiltonians yield results in close agreement with
  experiment also for nuclei not included in the fit
  \cite{Ekstrom:2015rta,Ekstrom:2013kea,Ekstrom:2014dxa}. Our recent
  applications to studies of the neutron and weak-charge distributions
  of $^{48}$Ca \cite{Hagen:2015yea} yield an excellent agreement with data. These results indicate that the neutron skin
  (difference between the radii of the neutron and proton
  distributions) is significantly smaller than previously
  thought. These calculations can in turn provide a constraint on the
  size of a neutron star.  Our progress in CC theory is
  summarized in two recent reviews~\cite{Hagen:2014ve,Hagen:2016xjv}.



\item {\bf Many-body perturbation theory and shell model
    interactions.}  In close collaboration with colleagues in Japan,
  we have extended our degenerate MBPT formalism (appropriate for one
  major shell only) to non-degenerate MBPT, allowing for studies of
  nuclei with degrees of freedom arising from more than one major
  shell.  In Ref.~\cite{Tsunoda:2016fjh} we applied the newly developed
  formalism to studies of exotic neutron-rich medium-mass nuclei.  The
  effective shell-model interactions derived using non-degenerate MBPT
  \cite {Tsunoda:2016fjh,Tsunoda:2013bla} were used to study
  energies and transition probabilities of neutron-rich Ne, Mg and Si
  isotopes. These are nuclei in the so-called {\em island of
    inversion} mass region. Previous shell-model studies of these systems
  have used phenomenologically tuned interactions. In
  Ref.~\cite{Tsunoda:2016fjh} we showed that a proper derivation of
  multi-shell effective interactions and the inclusion of three-body
  forces result in a better description of experiment, without the
  need of fine-tuning selected matrix elements.


\item {\bf CC and IMSRG calculations of quantum dots.} We have also
  performed extensive studies of quantum dots using IMSRG and CC
  theory, together with our MBPT and FCI codes as well as our
  diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) codes. The DMC results serve as
  benchmark for the other methods. We find an excellent agreement
  between CC theory and IMSRG at the CCSD and IMSRG(2) levels of approximation
  for closed-shell systems with up to $N=56$ electrons. The CC
  and IMSRG results agree also well with the quasi-exact DMC results.
  Using the EOM-IMSRG discussed above and the analogous EOM-CCSD
  approach we have also evaluated the addition and removal energies
  for the same closed-shell systems. These results are
  obtained as a collaborative effort between three of our graduate
  students (Novario, Parzuchowski and Yuan) and will be published early 2017.

\subsubsection{Results under prior NSF support: Broader impacts }

One of our aims during the previous grant period was to develop an
open source library that can be used by other nuclear theorists and/or
serve students and post-doctoral fellows as a resource for learning
about advanced methods like CC theory and the IMSRG.  In our recent
Lecture Notes in Physics book (to be published in early 2017)
entitled {\em An advanced course in computational nuclear physics;
Bridging the scales from quarks to neutron stars} and edited by MHJ,
Van Kolck and Lombardo, we have together with our graduate students
and other colleagues, written two long chapters on the application of
the above many-methods to neutron matter. These chapters contain
links to our codes, which are fully open source and contain
benchmark calculations to ensure reproducibility of results. The text focuses on how to
develop large-scale many-body codes, with infinite neutron and nuclear
matter as examples, starting with a serial code and ending up with final product that can be tailored to present high-performance computing
facilities. The codes are accesible from the GitHub
link \url{https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/LectureNotesPhysics/tree/master/doc/src}. Many elements of the text have also entered
different courses we teach, in particular the various Nuclear Talent
courses that we have developed for the larger nuclear physics community. The text and associated codes can freely be used by our
colleagues in advanced nuclear physics courses elsewhere.
